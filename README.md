### **What is this app, and how does it work?**

This application is a Street Fighter 6 Fantasy League creator. You and up to 4 friends can all set up a fantasy league amongst yourselves, create a team of your favourite players, and stay tuned throughout the season as scores update with each passing event.
To start, head on over to the league page where you can either create a league or join an existing one. Once you and all your friends are in a league, you can set up a draft order and begin the draft. During the draft, users pick players in a snake draft order, that is:

- A -> B -> C -> C -> B -> A -> A -> B -> ...

Once each team has 5 players, the draft is complete and the league begins! From the moment of your draft completion, every scoring event will add points to the players within your league, and by the end of the season, whichever team has the most points wins!

### **How does scoring work?**

*This information is not final*

After any scoring event (displayed in the events tab), points are awarded to the top 64 players of that event according to the event tier. Tier 1 events are the big ones: almost exclusviely CPT circuit tournaments with the exception of some big ones (think 1000+ entrants). You can take a look at the distribution tables below:

| Position       | Tier 1 | Tier 2 |
|----------------|--------|--------|
| 1              | 100    | 50     |
| 2              | 80     | 40     |
| 3              | 70     | 35     |
| 4              | 60     | 30     |
| 5 (tied)       | 50     | 25     |
| 7 (tied)       | 40     | 20     |
| 9 (tied)       | 30     | 15     |
| 13 (tied)      | 20     | 10     |
| 17 (tied)      | 10     | 5      |
| 25 (tied)      | 6      | 3      |
| 33 (tied)      | 4      | 2      |
| 49 (tied)      | 1      | 1      |

The top 4 placing active players within your team will receive points. So, should all 5 players of your team place within the top 64, only the best 4 placings will be considered. In the event of a tie, for example:

- Player 1: 1st
- Player 2: 3rd
- Player 3: 9th tied
- Player 4: 25th tied
- Player 5: 25th tied

The points will be awarded to either player 4 or player 5 at random. Points awarded to the players within your team are then awarded to your team as a whole. So, should a player collect 52 points for your team, then you decide to trade him away, you will not lose those points.

The cumulative points collected by players over the season can also be viewed at any time, so you can check out how many points that player you decided not to take collected ;).
